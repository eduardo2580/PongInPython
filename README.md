## Requirements

## How to Play

Ultimate Pong starts with a menu screen displaying the game title and instructions. After pressing **ENTER**, a countdown begins, and the game starts. Control your paddle to bounce the ball and score against your opponent. The first player to reach 5 points wins!

## Controls

- **Player A (Left Paddle):**
  - **Move Up:** `W`
  - **Move Down:** `S`
- **Player B (Right Paddle):**
  - **Move Up:** `Up Arrow`
  - **Move Down:** `Down Arrow`
- **Game Controls:**
  - **ENTER:** Start the game (from the menu)
  - **P:** Pause/Resume the game
  - **SPACE:** Reset the ball position
  - **ESCAPE:** Exit the game

## Game Mechanics

- **Ball Movement:** The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the top and bottom borders.
- **Paddle Collision:** When the ball hits a paddle, it reverses direction.
- **Scoring:** When the ball goes past a paddle, the opposing player earns a point.
- **Winning:** The game declares a winner once a player reaches the winning score (5 by default) and then returns to the menu.
- **Countdown:** A countdown timer prepares players for the next round after scoring.

## Customization

Feel free to tweak the following settings in the code:
- **Paddle Dimensions & Speed:** Adjust `PADDLE_WIDTH`, `PADDLE_HEIGHT`, and `PADDLE_SPEED`.
- **Ball Speed:** Modify `BALL_SPEED_X` and `BALL_SPEED_Y` for faster or slower gameplay.
- **Winning Score:** Change the `WINNING_SCORE` constant to extend or shorten matches.
- **Aesthetics:** Customize colors by editing the `WHITE` and `BLACK` variables.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify that you are running Python 3.x.
- If the game window fails to launch, check your Turtle graphics compatibility.
